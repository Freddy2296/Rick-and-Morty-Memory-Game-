# RICK-AND-MORTY-MEMORY-GAME-


# UX
## Project Goals
The goal with this project was to create a fun memory game based on the hit cartoon tv series Rick and Morty,
what I want is for user to enjoy this game and have fun  with the loveable characthers they know and love.
I want the user to be challenged a little too by this game but to also have fun at the same time, but overall 
I just wanted to create a game I can enjoy myself and share with people with who also enjoy the tv series Rick and Morty.
